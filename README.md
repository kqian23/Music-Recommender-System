# Music-Recommender-System
I built a binary music recommendation system using classification models including *logistic regression*, *Random Rorest*, and *Gradient Boosting Machine*. 

A summary of the qualitative analysis of this project can be found on my [Portfolio Website](https://www.notion.so/Build-a-Music-Recommendation-System-163a788ec55341d9867588a8dbe0251c)

The data set comes from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/MusicHackathon/discussion/2242).
